# ToDoApp
A Simple Todo Application Front end developed using angular 8. Works with the Java Spring Boot MySQL backend from https://github.com/arjunvenugopal/todo-backend

NOTE: CORS is not handled in this solution. So both front end and backend has to be deployed on the same server for it to work.

While deploying the app manually, change:
  <base href="<Name of the App>">
